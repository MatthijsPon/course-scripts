# If you want all the samples in a directory ran, give a regular expression with which the program can recognize
# the structure of your data. Make sure that paired data only differs by the numbers 1 and 2. Your general expression
# should have "{}" on the location of a 1 or 2.

# If you leave the general expression empty, the program will try to run the samples given in sample_name. Make sure
# that the paired samples are in a tuple e.g. ("S1.fq", "S2.fq"). The naming of samples does not matter in this mode.
